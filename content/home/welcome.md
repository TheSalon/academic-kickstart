The Salon is a lab dedicated to the study of Statistics, Algorithms, Learning, and OptimizatioN. It is led by Professor [Gautam Kamath](http://www.gautamkamath.com/) at the Cheriton School of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. Current emphases of the lab include enriching our understanding of data privacy and robustness in statistics and machine learning.

The name of The Salon is in reference to the [French tradition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salon_(gathering)) from the 17th and 18th centuries, a central venue for exchange of some of the most important ideas of the era.
